# Analysis of STARS hindcast data using Python
This is a collection of Python scripts that I used while writing my Bachelor's thesis "Analysis of Spatial Patterns in STARS-Generated Data using Complex Networks and Kappa-Statistics" at the [Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de) in 2016 under the supervision of Norbert Marwan and Prof. JÃ¼rgen Kurths.

The STARS model is developed at PIK, more details are [here](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/climate-impacts-and-vulnerabilities/models/stars). My analysis of the STARS-hindcast dataset can be found in [my thesis](thesis.pdf).

## Usage
The `scripts` directory contains the scripts that can be used to handle STARS and BASIS data. My basic workflow can be seen in `scripts/main.py`. Please update the scripts/misc/paths.py to match your local directory structure. The files `scripts/misc/functions.py` and `scripts/misc/plotting.py` provide some additional work that might be useful for others.

The `meta` directory contains the meta data file I used while handling the STARS and Basis data.

The `pkg` directory contains work provided by Aljoscha Rheinwalt that was used to calculate Event Synchronization Networks and compute the Strength and Directionality measures.

## Requirements
The project is written in Python 2.  
 
In addition to the standard libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Progressbar and Pandas, the package 'NetworkMeasures' by Aljoscha Rheinwalt has to be installed, see `pkg/spat_corr`.

## Raw data structure                                   
The scripts expect the raw data in one single folder containing one file per station, e.g. `(id)simsz.dat` for STARS data and `(id)basz.dat` for BASIS data.
